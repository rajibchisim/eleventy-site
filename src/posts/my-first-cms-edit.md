title: Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer
slug: first
description: But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
  the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
  truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
  avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
  know.

# Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. And I'm his friend Jesus. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

__ don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up!__ *Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.* I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

## No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

One hundred dollars. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

1. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
2. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
3. I'm a thing.

### Anyone who laughs is a communist!

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. With gusto. Ummm…to eBay?

* Fatal.
* Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.
* Tell them I hate them.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You can see how I lived before I met you. Soon enough. We're also Santa Claus!

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! You lived before you met me?! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Yeah, lots of people did. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

I'll get my kit! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Throw her in the brig. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Look, last night was a mistake. No! Don't jump! And until then, I can never die? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Large bet on myself in round one.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…
