excerpt: Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
  and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
  Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
  small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
  necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
  sentences fly into your mouth.

## Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

What?! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I call it luck. I can't get involved! **I've got work to do!** *It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.* It's such a long way from here.

## You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. He is here. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

1. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
2. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
3. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

### You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

* I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
* You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
* Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

You mean it controls your actions? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Ye-ha!

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You mean it controls your actions? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

What?! Red Five standing by. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Don't underestimate the Force. I find your lack of faith disturbing. As you wish. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… You mean it controls your actions?

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
