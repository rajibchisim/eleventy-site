title: I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. changed today.
description: Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
  Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
  Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
  small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
  necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
  sentences fly into your mouth.

# I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. __I don't know why.__ *I call me the Doctor too.* I still don't know why.

## Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Saving the world with meals on wheels. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

1. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
2. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
3. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

### I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

* Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
* No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
* I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

You've swallowed a planet! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
