# Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. **You can't just have your characters announce how they feel.** *That makes me feel angry!* Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

## Kids have names?

Really?! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

1. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
2. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
3. Ooh, name it after me!

### Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Who am I making this out to? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

* Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
* Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
* Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Tell them I hate them. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Belligerent and numerous. No! Don't jump!

```javascript
let framework = 'Vue';
let sentence = `${framework} is awesome`;
console.log(sentence)
 // logs "Vue is awesome"
framework = 'React';
console.log(sentence)
//should log "React is awesome" if 'sentence' is reactive.
```

How much did you make me? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

That's not soon enough! Kif might! Guess again. We're rescuing ya. Leela's gonna kill me. No, I'm Santa Claus!

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? File not found. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Why would a robot need to drink? Actually, that's still true. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

Say it in Russian! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

Bender, quit destroying the universe! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Ooh, name it after me! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

A true inspiration for the children. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. And then the battle's not so bad? Shut up and get to the point! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
